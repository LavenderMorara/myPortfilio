<p>Hi! I'm Lavender, a self-taught web developer passionate about building websites and applications. I love experimenting with code, solving problems, and bringing ideas to life through design and functionality.</p>
<p>I started my journey by learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and now I’m exploring more advanced technologies like React and Node.js. My goal is to become a skilled front-end developer and create user-friendly, interactive websites.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, working on side projects, or improving my skills through online courses.</p>
